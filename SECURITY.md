# Security Policy

We take the security of Discord Bots Hub seriously. Thank you for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities to help keep the community safe.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main` branch | ✅ |
| Tagged releases | ✅ |

Fixes are applied to the `main` branch and the latest stable release (if applicable). Older releases may not receive backports.

## Reporting a vulnerability

1. **Do not create a public issue.**
2. Email the maintainers at **security@discordbotshub.dev** with:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce (ideally a minimal proof of concept).
   - Impact assessment (what an attacker can achieve).
   - Suggested remediation (optional but appreciated).
3. Encrypt your message with PGP if possible (public key coming soon).

We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and provide a status update within **5 business days**. High-impact issues will be prioritised.

## Disclosure process

1. Confirm the report and assign a severity.
2. Develop and test a fix privately.
3. Coordinate a release with the reporter.
4. Publish a security advisory with credit (unless anonymity is requested).

## Safe harbour

We will not pursue legal action for good faith security research that follows this policy. Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, service disruption, or data destruction. Test only on systems you own or have permission to test.

Thank you for helping us protect the Discord Bots Hub community! 💙
